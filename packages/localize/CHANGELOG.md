# Change Log

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 09d96759: Add types for localize package. JSDocs types in the .js files, TSC generates type definition files. Mixins type definition files are hand-typed.
- 9ecab4d5: Removing LionSingleton as es modules are already guaranteed to be singletons.
  This reduces complexity and means less code to ship to our users.

### Patch Changes

- 3c61fd29: Add types to form-core, for everything except form-group, choice-group and validate. Also added index.d.ts (re-)export files to git so that interdependent packages can use their types locally.
- Updated dependencies [3c61fd29]
- Updated dependencies [09d96759]
- Updated dependencies [9ecab4d5]
  - @lion/core@0.9.0
  - singleton-manager@1.1.2

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
