# Change Log

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 3c61fd29: Add types to form-core, for everything except form-group, choice-group and validate. Also added index.d.ts (re-)export files to git so that interdependent packages can use their types locally.
- 09d96759: Added basic JSDocs types to SingletonManager, in order for localize to be able to be typed correctly.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
